## Super important update ##

- Instead of training the decoder to recover the embedded QR , create a CNN classifier instead of decoder that can classify if 
pattern are embedded or not 

- Use a moiree pattern that should be embedded in repeating manner across the entire images and the verification engine should just check
that whether there is some pattern present or not in the image

- After fixing an algorithm/ encoder to embed insvisible pattern , Prepare two datasets by first printing the images which has embedded
patterns in them and other image as not and capture those images via mobile phones then train our CNN classifier to classify if the pattern
is present or not.


1. Data Augmentation with Real-World Distortions


JPEG Compression: Simulate different compression levels (e.g., quality 50-90).
Blur & Motion Blur: Mimic slight defocusing and camera movement.
Lighting Variations: Adjust brightness, contrast, and shadows.
Perspective Warping: Simulate different camera angles and distortions.
Noise Injection: Add Gaussian and Poisson noise to simulate printing artifacts.


2. Super-Resolution for Watermark Extraction
Add a super-resolution module to refine the extracted watermark, making it more readable after distortions.
Use CNN-based or Transformer-based super-resolution networks.


3. Frequency Domain Processing
Embed the watermark in DWT-DCT or FFT domains instead of pixel space.
Frequency-based embedding is more resilient to compression and printing distortions.


4. Hybrid Encoder Architecture
Combine ResNet50/VGG16 feature extraction with transformer-based self-attention layers to enhance spatial consistency.


5. Adversarial Training with a Discriminator
Train a GAN-based discriminator to ensure that encoded images are indistinguishable from originals.
This helps prevent visible artifacts in the printed version.


6. Auto-Calibration Mechanism
Implement adaptive learning where the decoder estimates distortions and applies inverse transformations before extraction.


7. Use of a QR-Code-based Watermark
If the watermark is a QR code, use error correction (Reed-Solomon codes) to improve retrieval accuracy.
